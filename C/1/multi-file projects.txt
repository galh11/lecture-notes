several files can be compiled into one executable file:
> gcc main.c utility.c testing.c

in order to call a function F defined in file A.c from a different file B.c
F needs to be declared in A.c 
we could do so by straight-up declaring F 
or we can use define

The "-c" flag makes GCC stop after creating object files
> gcc -c utility.c testing.c 

results in object files: utility.o testing.o
instead of an executable: name.exe

> gcc utility.o testing.o main.o
