defining operators is done using operator overloading
c++ treats an operator like a function

Complex operator+(const Complex &c1, const Complex &c2)
{
    return Complex(c1.real + c2.real, c1.imaginary + c2.imaginary);
}

Complex c1(1.0, 2.0);
Complex c2(3.0, 4.0);
Complex c3 = c1 + c2; // c3 = operator+(c1, c2);

we cannot define new operators, only overload existing ones

we cannot change the number of parameters, precedence or associativity

an overloaded operator must have at least one user-defined type as a parameter.
