Dynamic memory allocations are done in c++ using the new and delete operators.

int *ptr = new int(5); // allocate memory for an int and initialize it to 5
int* array = new int[10](); // array of 10 ints, initialized to 0

delete ptr; // free the memory allocated for ptr
delete[] array; // free the memory allocated for array

- new and delete are typed (they allocate memory for a specific type)
    - unlike malloc and free, which return void*
- new initializes the object
    - So there is no “uninitialized memory” containing garbage
    - Built-in types (such as int) can be allocated with or without initialization
