cin - standard input
cout - standard output
cerr - standard error

printing to cout is done using the << operator
recieving input from cin is done using the >> operator
can concatanate multiple inputs/outputs

int main()
{
    int n;
    cin >> n; // read an integer from cin and store it in n
    cout << n << endl; // print n to cout
}

no need to remember control tags! (%s, %d, etc.)

can support input/output of new types!!!
